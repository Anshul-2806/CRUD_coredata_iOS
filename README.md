I'm Great Anshul Gupta have written this code. This code comprise of these following options:  
There are a few ways to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Swift, depending on your requirements. Let me provide you some options:

with Core Data:
Description: Core Data is an object graph and persistence framework provided by Apple for macOS and iOS. It allows you to organize data using the relational entity-attribute model and serialize it into XML, binary, or SQLite stores.
Pros:
Type-safe: Core Data maps Swift objects to database records.
Rich features: Supports relationships, versioning, and more.
Integrated with Xcode: Easy to set up and manage.
Cons:
Memory-intensive: Operates on records once they’re in memory.
Threading model: Expects to run on a single thread.
Example: You can create, retrieve, update, and delete data using Core Data. To get started, create a new project with “Use Core Data” selected, and configure your data models1
